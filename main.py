    lorem = "I woke up early this morning. After I woke up, I brushed my teeth. Then I went to the bathroom to wash my face. After washing my face, I got dressed for work. I had a quick breakfast before leaving the house. Then I walked to the train station to catch my train. I always take the same train to work every day. The train ride is usually about 30 minutes long. I like to read a book or listen to music during my commute. Once I arrive at the station, I walk to my office building. I work on the 6th floor of the building. My workday usually starts at 9am. I spend most of my day at my desk, working on my computer. Sometimes I have meetings with my colleagues. At lunchtime, I usually eat at the same cafe down the street. After work, I take the same train home and unwind for the evening."
